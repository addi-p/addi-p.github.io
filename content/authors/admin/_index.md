#      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends #driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural #networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#    summary: |
#      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage #complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great #day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, #working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Adrian Pelcaru is a PhD Student in theoretical physics at the Technische Universität Dresden in the newly founded institute Synergy of Systems (SynoSys) under the guidance of Prof. Dr. Dirk Brockmann. Adrian's interest revolve around investigating dynamic systems and developing methods that allow one to find causal relationships between time series that are assumed to belong to a dynamic system.
